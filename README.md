## about

Candy Shop was originally a React app, later rewritten with Vue 3 for learning purposes.  
The layout and structure were improved — you can check the first version under the `v1.0.0` tag.

On the home page, you can add items to the cart and view product details by clicking the cards.  
From the detail page, it’s also possible to add products to the cart, and the cart icon in the header takes you to the cart page, where you can increase or decrease quantities.
